# 2048_plus

Simple implementation of the popular 2048 game, made in C and ncurses

I made this program back when the game was very popular, and the lecture I was attending was kind of boring.

# Compiling

    gcc main.c -o 2048_plus -lncurses -lm

# Running

    ./2048_plus

# Hacking

To change the size of the board, you can change "gamew" and "gameh" in main.c, and then recompile
